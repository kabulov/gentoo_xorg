emerge twm xterm xclock -1

added vboxvideo to /etc/conf.d/modules as modules="vboxvideo".
rebuilt xf86-video-virtualbox and xorg-server, xorg worked.

make sure you have the driver 'virtualbox' in your make.conf file for your video card. 
try to install Xorg. 
issues : look at the /etc/portage/package.use file. 
you need to add 'x11-base/xorg-server udev' to it. 
install again. you might need more dependencies.
try and start it with a 'startx' command. 
take a look at the /var/log/Xorg.0.log file
install things it is complaining about

if you did everthing including make.conf and grub and fstab and kernel configuration is default(or as in gentoo handbook)
as it was described in gentoo_install repo then your steps are

https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Xorg/Configuration

or

emerge --ask x11-base/xorg-server
env-update
source /etc/profile
startx

places to go:
- /etc/X11/Sessions/
- /etc/X11/xinit/xinitrc
- /etc/env.d/90xdg-data-base
- /usr/lib64/xorg/modules/
- /var/log/Xorg.0.log
